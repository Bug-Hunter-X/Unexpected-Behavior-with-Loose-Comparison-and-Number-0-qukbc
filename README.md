# Unexpected Behavior with Loose Comparison and Number 0

This code demonstrates a common JavaScript error stemming from loose comparison (==) and the handling of the number 0.  The function `foo` aims to categorize numbers as negative, zero, or positive, but it produces an unexpected result for the input 0 because of JavaScript's loose equality behavior with null and zero.  The solution shows how to use strict equality (===) for clearer and more predictable comparisons.
